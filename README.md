# Move User Folders
Move User Folders is a simple application to change the location of your user folders on Windows. This saves you from having to do it one by one.

Note: A minimum of .NET Framework 3.5 is required for this app to work properly.

## Usage
After launching as administrator, you will be greeted by a simple interface.

You can select which directories you would like to relocate, and browse a location, or set different locations for all of them.
After selecting a folder, and a location, just click the 'Move folders' button, and let the app do the rest.

This is going to move all your folders, and edit the registry so they work as your new User Folders. A reboot/logout is recommended, however not neccessary.

If you're using Windows in a different language, don't worry; your folders will use the equivalent names in your language!
